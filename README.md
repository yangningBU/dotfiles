# dotfiles
This is how I stay alive... on various machines.

Install with `source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangningBU/dotfiles/master/dotfile-control.sh)`

You will notice there is a fork from [powerline](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-bash) here as well. This is somewhat modified as I did not succeed with the patched fonts.
